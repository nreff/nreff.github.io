1. Order of elements
2. Cyclic Groups, Cyclic Subgroups generated by an element <a>
3. Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups
4. Permutations, Permutation groups S_n, A_n
5. Properties of permutations (cycle structures, etc.)
6. Calculations in Permutation Groups (products, inverses, order, parity (even/odd) etc.)
7. Cosets: definitions, properties and calculations (finding cosets, number of distinct cosets, etc)
8. Lagrange's Theorem and consequences
9. Isomorphisms, automorphisms.  Show a mapping is an isomorphism/automorphism      (4 parts: well-defined, 1-1, onto, operation preserving)
10. Show two groups are not isomorphic by finding some fundamental properties that are different.
11. Show two groups are isomorphic by the classification of cyclic groups.
